# Model_Averaging_Simulation

The traditional model averaging has the constraint of weight summing to one. Ando and Li suggested an approach of model averaging without that constraint but requires weight values to be restricted between 0 and 1. We hypothesized that there might be a difference in performance if we allow weight values from negative to positive infinity. A simulation work is presented using the same dataset as in the Ando and Li's paper.
